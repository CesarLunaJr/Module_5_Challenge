Pymaceuticals, Inc. - Tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and a top-level summary of the results.

Analysis:

In the summary statistics ramicane, capomulin, ceftamin, and infubinol had the smallest tumor volume standard error, respectively. This made these drugs the optimal choices to further drill down upon and investigate drug efficacy.
As you look at the mean tumor volumes, you'll notice the mice on these (4) drugs also demonstrated the smallest mean but infubinol did have an outlier in their results while the rest did not.
The final tumor sizes were found to be smallest in ramicane at 36.6 (mm3) and capomulin at 38.1 (mm3).
The correlation of 0.84 proves there is a positive correlation between weight and average tumor volume for mice on the capomulin regimen.
I would recommend further investigating ramicane and capomulin in order to derive additional correlations and possible insights.
